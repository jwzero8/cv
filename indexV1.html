              <h2>More about me</h2>
              <p>Hi, this is Jordan. I am striving for a career in the field of web-development and software development. 
                <br>
                Recently I am learning through reading books, attending courses and doing projects.
            </p>
            <p>Why I take a career switch?</p> 
                <div class="motto">"Do what you love. Love what you do."</div>
                 <p>Apparently, developing webpages and software which require intellectual thinking and implementation appeal to me.
                    It is my own belief that man can be successful only if he has a strong determination towards one goal. In my case, it is the passion and pleasure to design webpages/software that are useful to others.
                 </p>
                 <p><u>P.S. I love doing voluntary jobs as well. Even though we live in a business world. I am still willing to spend my time to work on meaningful projects helping the needy as I receive a lot of help from others. Contact me by clicking the link at the bottom if you have such plans for helping the underserved.</u></p>
                 <div class="motto">"It is every man's obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it."</div>
